# Sandwich Shop App

**A Java CLI Point-of-Sale Application for a Sandwich Shop**

## 📋 Project Overview

**The Sandwich Shop** is a Java-based command-line point-of-sale (POS) system designed for a growing custom sandwich shop. It allows users to fully customize sandwich orders, add sides like drinks and chips, and generate detailed order receipts. This app modernizes the manual, paper-based system previously used by the shop.
